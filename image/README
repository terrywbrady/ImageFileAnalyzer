This code requires the following additional libraries in order to execute.

Java Advanced Imaging 1.1.4 jai_core.jar 
Java Advanced Imaging 1.1.4 jai_codec.jar 

It is difficult to find these jars online, so this implementation is likely obsolete.  A different library should be found for this functionality. 
Perhaps Apache Tika can accomplish the same goal.

If you can find them, add these files to your local maven repository.

mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=javax.media -DartifactId=jai_core -Dversion=1.1.4 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=<path-to-file>
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.sun.media -DartifactId=jai_codec -Dversion=1.1.4 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=<path-to-file>

This package also uses Apache Tika which is availabe via the Maven central repository.

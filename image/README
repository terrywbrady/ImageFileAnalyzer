This code has been derived from the NARA File Analyzer and Metadata Harvester which is available at 
https://github.com/usnationalarchives/File-Analyzer.

PREREQUISITES
- JDK 1.6 or higher
- Maven (or you will need to compile the modules manually)

Maven module dependencies
- Core file analyzer: 
	https://github.com/terrywbrady/File-Analyzer
	Build and install this to your local maven repository
- Apache Tika
	Availabe in the Apache Maven Repostiory

This code requires the following additional libraries in order to execute.

Java Advanced Imaging 1.1.4 jai_core.jar 
Java Advanced Imaging 1.1.4 jai_codec.jar 

It is difficult to find these jars online, so this implementation is likely obsolete.  A different library should be found for this functionality. 
Perhaps Apache Tika can accomplish the same goal.

If you can find them, add these files to your local maven repository.

mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=javax.media -DartifactId=jai_core -Dversion=1.1.4 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=<path-to-file>
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.sun.media -DartifactId=jai_codec -Dversion=1.1.4 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=<path-to-file>

INSTALLATION
- Clone this code to your computer
- Run mvn install

DEPLOYMENTS
- The resulting target directory will contain a full list of all of the components of Apache Tika
- ImageFileAnalyzer.jar is a self-extracting jar file that references all of the dependent jar files
